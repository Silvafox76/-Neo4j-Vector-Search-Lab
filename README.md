# 🧠 Neo4j Vector Search Lab

This project explores the power of **graph databases** and **vector search** using Neo4j and the Cypher query language. It models global air routes as a graph and performs semantic similarity searches using node embeddings.

---

## ✈️ Project Overview

- Modeled an air route network using airports, countries, continents, and route relationships.
- Executed Cypher queries to:
  - Retrieve nodes and relationships
  - Filter and update data
  - Perform advanced pattern matching
- Loaded pre-trained embeddings into Neo4j nodes
- Created a vector index with cosine similarity
- Ran **vector similarity search** to find semantically related airports

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Neo4j** (Graph DB)
- **Cypher** (Query Language)
- **Python** (Driver for Cypher)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Execution Environment)
- **dotenv** for environment variable management
